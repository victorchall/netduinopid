PID Controller for Netduino is an toolset for creating and implementing
arbitrary feedback controls, though will include specific PID-style control
implementations. 

Since Netduino is already based on managed code langauge with fairly robust 
hardware the goal of the project is to enourage code reuse and ease of design
rather than runtime optimization.  Those looking for very high frequency
calculation may want to look elsewhere, or simply handcode their loop.
